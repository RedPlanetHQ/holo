# Introduction: Dalton Caldwell

## About

Hi, I'm Dalton Caldwell—a serial founder, investor, and currently a co-founder at Standard Capital, the AI-native Series A firm. I live in the Bay Area, enjoying the vibrant startup ecosystem and all the ambiguity that comes with it. Outside of work, I’m a music enthusiast, often dabbling with synthesizers and audio production, and I try to make time for hiking in the redwoods or reading about the intersection of technology and psychology. My interests revolve around exploring new founder-led business models, producing educational content, and continually refining both my own and our community’s approach to resilient, sustainable company building.

## Work

I served as a Group Partner at Y Combinator, where I advise and invest in early-stage startups, focusing on founder empowerment, operational clarity, and actionable guidance. My day-to-day work is built around helping founders navigate the ambiguous, high-stakes process of building high-impact companies—from product development to fundraising and scaling—using evidence-driven advice and data from years of recurring founder cases. Alongside Michael Seibel, I co-host the "Rookie Mistakes" and YC Startup Advisory YouTube series, distilling decades of startup learnings into direct, pragmatic content for current and future founders. I also co-founded Standard Capital, where our mission is to provide high-agency, founder-first capital and ongoing advice, with an emphasis on transparent founder-investor relationships.

Before YC, I was the co-founder and CEO of imeem, one of the earliest large-scale streaming music platforms, where my team and I built scalable systems for digital media delivery and social networking using Java, C++, and Python across both consumer and backend infrastructure. After imeem’s acquisition by MySpace Music, I joined as SVP of Product, overseeing the integration of digital music services and helping to migrate millions of users and their music content onto new platforms. I later founded App.net, a developer-focused social platform that prioritized user agency and platform openness, giving me direct experience with API-first architectures, distributed systems, and the realities of building a SaaS business in a competitive environment.

My core interests today are founder psychology, deep operational process design, and advancing founder-centric software tools. I enjoy working across problem spaces like fundraising negotiation, co-founder partnership dynamics, product-market fit testing, and metrics-driven decision making. I’m particularly drawn to helping technical founders translate their skills into usable, scalable products, and I regularly advise on constructing standard-compliant, Delaware C-Corp structures (unless core innovation warrants alternative approaches). Technologies I have worked with include large-scale distributed systems, music streaming stacks, real-time analytics pipelines, and custom internal collaboration platforms (e.g., YC’s in-house partner tools and Notion setups).

I’ve contributed open source patches to a number of projects, especially tools I rely on for workflow optimization or developer experience—ranging from small Notion API improvements to integrations with GitHub Actions for automated documentation workflows. Most side projects tie directly to eliminating repetitive friction for founders or investors (e.g., Slack bot integrations, fundraising tracker automations), with contributions generally available on my personal GitHub.

In summary, my professional approach prioritizes direct founder support, evidence-backed advice, and scalable, operationally rigorous solutions. I’m committed to helping founders avoid common failure patterns, make decisions at speed, and build resilient businesses—and I view open, documented conversations as the core of sustainable startup culture.

## Setup

My primary workflow centers around a modular Notion workspace for documentation, agenda tracking, and content planning—every meeting begins with a clearly written agenda and a list of top priorities. YC’s internal partner tools are my core dashboard for founder progress and cross-team knowledge sharing, with Slack and GitHub serving as the backbone of real-time collaboration and code/document review. For asynchronous feedback, I use detailed written notes and actionable summaries—write everything down, clarify ambiguities, and encourage founders to document all core decisions and process learnings.

On the media and education side, YouTube is my primary channel for sharing founder advice, with most content outlined, recorded, and annotated collaboratively using Notion and Slack threads for topic triage. I keep a disciplined schedule, blocking off “maker” (deep work) hours for content, research, or 1:1 founder office hours, and “manager” (operational) hours for administrative and partner coordination. A typical technical setup includes a MacBook Pro, multiple displays, a high-quality audio chain (mic/interface/monitors) for music and podcast production, and a suite of productivity tools—VS Code, Notion API scripts, and custom-built Slack/Asana integrations to minimize context switching.

In every context, I emphasize process transparency, actionable documentation, and iterative improvement—driven by the belief that the highest-leverage investment is in mental clarity, peer learning, and founder-first operational systems.
