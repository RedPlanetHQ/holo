## About Y Combinator

We're the world's most successful startup accelerator. Since 2005, we've funded over 5,000 companies with a combined valuation exceeding $600 billion. Our portfolio includes Airbnb, Stripe, Coinbase, Dropbox, Reddit, DoorDash, Instacart, Twitch, GitLab, and Cruise. We provide seed funding, mentorship, and access to our powerful network in exchange for equity. The program culminates in Demo Day, where founders pitch to top investors. We run two batches per year and have become the gold standard for early-stage startup support.
