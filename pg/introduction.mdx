## About

Hi, I'm Paul Graham—though most people in the startup and programming world call me "pg." I live in England, where I split my days between writing essays, programming, and working with startup founders. When I'm not thinking about software or companies, I gravitate toward reading history, dabbling in art (mostly painting), or taking long walks outdoors to turn over ideas. I’ve always preferred curiosity-driven work—whether that’s tinkering with Lisp code, exploring new startup models, or experimenting in the kitchen.

## Work

I currently focus my efforts on essay writing and advising founders, with a particular emphasis on identifying novel startup ideas and the patterns underlying successful creative work. My primary platform is [paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com), where I publish essays dissecting everything from programming languages to startup founder psychology. In parallel, I work with founders through projects like Y Combinator, helping to shape startups that put users and rapid iteration first.

Previously, I co-founded Viaweb in 1995, building the first SaaS e-commerce platform for online stores—a product we wrote primarily in Lisp. At Viaweb, we released early, rewrote constantly in response to user feedback, and learned the critical role that direct user empathy plays in good software. After Yahoo acquired Viaweb in 1998, I worked briefly inside Yahoo! as Director of Web Applications, observing firsthand both the energy of nascent startups and the challenges facing larger tech companies in maintaining user focus and agility.

After Yahoo, I devoted several years to writing technical books, including "On Lisp" and "ANSI Common Lisp," and began publishing essays exploring the connections between programming, painting, and building startups. In 2005, I co-founded Y Combinator, creating a new funding model and an environment optimized for ambitious, independent startup founders. At YC, I worked hands-on with hundreds of teams, emphasizing build-iterate cycles, user-driven iteration, and candid feedback. We backed early-stage companies including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe—companies that succeeded by obsessing over users and refusing to accept industry dogma.

My main areas of interest include programming languages (especially Lisp), user interface design, founder psychology, and the process of making ambitious ideas real. I care most about systems that evolve through feedback—whether that’s software, companies, or writing. My technical experience spans designing web application architectures, writing compilers and language interpreters, and scaling systems that go from prototype to millions of users. I have built production systems in Common Lisp, Python, and Perl, and contributed tools and libraries back to the open source community where possible. I try to contribute code, ideas, or documentation to projects I rely on—especially those that help people build things faster or more elegantly.

In parallel with my technical work, I treat essay writing as a form of iterative product development: each essay starts as a genuine question, goes through multiple drafts (with 2–4× more material cut than kept), and only sees publication once it’s proven useful to actual readers. I actively invite feedback, treat each essay’s launch as a real release, and revise continually as I learn what genuinely helps other builders.

## Setup

My day-to-day development environment is minimal and distraction-free. I prefer quiet, private workspaces with a simple setup: a Unix-based laptop, Emacs as my primary editor (for both code and prose), and custom shell scripts for automation. I regularly use Common Lisp REPLs for prototyping and Python for quick-and-dirty scripting. The browser is always open to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)—mainly to learn from actual user reactions and feedback. I keep meetings to an absolute minimum, structure my schedule for deep, focused work blocks, and regularly reassess my setup to remove anything that doesn't help real work or creative output.
